# TerraNalysis

TerraNalysis is a mobile application developed using Flutter that works with an IoT-based soil monitoring device. It provides real-time data on soil Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), Moisture, and pH levels, allowing farmers and gardeners to make informed decisions for healthier crops and sustainable agriculture.

Using a Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller, the system sends data to a mobile app that displays soil insights and offers automated fertilizer recommendations. Comparative testing has proven its effectiveness in supporting sustainable and efficient farming. TerraNalysis is a cost-effective, scalable solution suitable for farms of all sizes, with future plans to enhance predictive soil modeling for even more precise nutrient management.
